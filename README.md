# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Overview

Make web page with cards. HTML CSS JS is used.

**Figma**

* [Link to the project in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/SurN1jaeEQIhuZEDMhmWWf/Sprint-4-Around-The-U.S.-desktop-mobile?node-id=0%3A1)

* [Link to the project in GH Pages] (https://gregorydich.github.io/web_project_4/index.html)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

Have fun with JavaScript!
